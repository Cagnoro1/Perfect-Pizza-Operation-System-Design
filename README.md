# Perfect-Pizza-Operation-System-Design
In this project, we use SQL code to create a system to make a Pizza company run their business effectively.

For Perfect Pizza, we spearheaded the development of a comprehensive system to track pizza and Buffalo wing orders. This involved creating a data flow diagram (DFD) to map processes, enumerating entities and attributes, designing and populating database tables, and generating entity-relationship diagrams (ERD) for efficient data management. Additionally, we implemented SQL queries to retrieve customer profiles, manage orders, compute final costs, and track weekly totals for data comparison, ensuring seamless operations and improved customer service.

At Perfect Pizza, we led the creation of a system to keep track of pizza and Buffalo wing orders. This involved drawing diagrams to understand how information moves through the system, listing all the important details about customers and their orders, setting up databases to store this information, and making sure everything connects properly. With SQL queries, we could quickly find customer details, manage orders, calculate costs, and keep track of weekly sales, making sure everything runs smoothly for our customers and the business.
